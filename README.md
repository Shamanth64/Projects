 # Building an Online Banking System with Java, Spring Boot, and Bootstrap
In today's digital age, online banking systems are indispensable, providing users with the convenience of managing their finances from anywhere. Recently, I developed an online banking system using Java and Spring Boot for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of the project, all developed in IntelliJ IDEA.

Technologies Used

Backend:

Java: For robust and scalable backend logic.

Spring Boot: To simplify the setup and development of the application.

Spring Data JPA: For seamless database interactions.

Spring Security: To secure the application.

H2/MySQL Database: For storing user data and transaction information.

Frontend:

HTML: For structuring web pages.

CSS: For styling and enhancing visual appeal.

Bootstrap: For responsive design and pre-styled components.

Development Environment:

IntelliJ IDEA: A powerful IDE for coding, debugging, and running the application.

System Architecture
Backend (Spring Boot)
The backend is designed to handle business logic, database interactions, and serve data to the frontend.

Key Components:

Controllers: Manage HTTP requests and responses.

Services: Contain the business logic.

Repositories: Interface with the database.

Entities: Represent the data models.
